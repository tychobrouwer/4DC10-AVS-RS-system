    "# 1 Subject\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's competitive environment, in which deliveries need to be faster and order sizes become smaller, forces material handling providers to progressively develop new and better solutions. A recent development in automated material-handling technology for unit load storage and retrieval is the autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS). Figure 1 shows a representation of an AVS/RS for the handling of totes, while Figure 2 illustrates a single tier (floor, level). The storage racks are single-deep and double-sided. Each storage position is of the same size and can hold one tote. Lifts are mounted at fixed locations at one end of each storage aisle. The input/output (I/O) point is located at the first tier beside each lift. Autonomous vehicles are dedicated to a storage aisle within a specific tier (so-called tier-captive configuration). The first position on either side of the storage aisle in all tiers serves as a buffer and is used to manage the transfer of totes between vehicles and lifts (see Figure 2). One buffer (out) handles totes which have been retrieved, the other one (in), located on the other side of the storage aisle, handles the totes to be stored. The presence of these buffers allows the lift and vehicle to work independently of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The throughput performance of AVS/RS systems can be affected by design decisions (such as number of tiers, number of aisles, and depth of aisles) as well as operational decisions (such as tote storage location and order assignment).\n",

    "# 2 Goal\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to study this new material handling solution by using computer simulation. This study can be restricted to the retrieval process only, i.e., the vehicles perform only single retrieval cycles. Clearly, the retrieval phase is the most critical activity from an organisational viewpoint, as it is directly related to customer service level and &mdash; in contrast to the storage phase &mdash; it cannot be postponed to a period of low workload. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "- Develop a simulation model of one aisle that consists of several tiers with retrieval process to assess the system performance in terms of throughput and flow time.\n",
    "- Systematically develop the model process by process, and verify and validate each process using analytical results.\n",
    "- Investigate design trade-offs, i.e., via different layouts (number of columns and tiers), for this material handling system."

    "# 3 Description of the AVS/RS\n",
    "The AVS/RS is a fully automated system that can store and retrieve unit loads. The unit loads are placed in totes, a type of box, and these totes are placed in a designated aisle and column for storage. When retrieved, an autonomous vehicle places the totes in a buffer at the end of the aisle. There is one autonomous vehicle for every aisle within the tier. This is called the tier-captive configuration. From the buffer, the totes are picked by a lift that serves all tiers in one aisle, see Figure 2. In this assignment only one aisle that consists of $Levels$ tiers has to be modelled. Each aisle has depth number of columns of width $dv$ metres and height $dl$ metres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests for a tote arrive for each tier, asking for a tote with a random (uniformly distributed) column assigned to it. The inter arrival time of requests is exponentially distributed with mean value $arrive$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicles transport totes along the aisle (one vehicle per tier). The time taken by the vehicle to process an order depends on the tote's location. The vehicle has to travel to this location, load the tote (it takes a fixed amount of time equal to $lv$ seconds), then go back to the end of the aisle and, finally, unload the tote to the buffer (again this takes $lv$ seconds). The speed profile of each vehicle is described as follows. First, the vehicle goes with a constant acceleration $av$ *m/s$^2$* until it reaches its maximum velocity $vmaxv$, then it moves with this velocity and decelerates with a constant deceleration $av$ to approach its destination point. If the tote is located too close to the end of the aisle, it is possible that the vehicle will not reach its maximum speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicles unload the totes to a location where it is picked up by the lift. At any given time only one tote per tier is allowed to occupy such a position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lift transports the totes from every tier to the ground floor. The processing time depends on the tote's location and the fixed time to load and unload the tote ($ll$ seconds for loading and $ll$ seconds for unloading). The maximum speed of the lift is $vmaxl$ $m/s$ with a speed profile similar to that of the vehicles (constant acceleration/deceleration of $al$ *m/s<sup>2</sup>*)."

    "A brief description of the processes is given below:\n",
    "- **G:** The generator models the arrival of orders for totes. There is one generator per tier.\n",
    "- **DB:** The demand buffer stores the orders to be picked up by the vehicles. The vehicle processes the orders under first-come-first-serve policy. It can always receive a tote, but it releases a tote only when the vehicle is ready to pick it up.\n",
    "- **V:** The vehicle can be modeled as a server with a variable processing time.\n",
    "- **GDV:** The process consisting of a Generator, Demand Buffer and Vehicle for one tier of the AVS/RS system.\n",
    "- **B:** The buffer stores the totes from the vehicles awaiting for a pick-up by the lift. The buffer operates under first-come-first-serve policy and has a finite capacity of $bc$ totes per tier. So, every tier has a buffer location of finite capacity of $bc$ totes. All those locations together form the buffer B that accommodates all the totes which are processed by the same lift. When the buffer is not empty (there is at least one tote on one of the tiers), the buffer sends information about the tier of the longest waiting tote to the lift upon request. This information is used by the lift to determine the location of the tote (the number of the tier the tote is located in). Once the lift is ready to pick it up, the tote is released to the lift. There are two types of queues in the buffer: $xs$ contains all the totes to be picked up by the lift and there are $Levels$ counters $n$ counting the totes from the corresponding tier.\n",
    "- **L:** The lift, similar to the process **V**, is modeled as a machine with a variable processing time. A lift first receives a destination tier. Then the process delays for time required for the lift to go to the tote location and pick up the tote. Then it receives the tote, and next it delays for the time required to go to the ground floor and to unload the tote. After that the lift process is ready to release the tote to the Exit process.\n",
    "- **E:** In the exit process all the data related to each tote are collected. This process calculates the average throughput and the average flow-time. The number of totes to be processed by the AVS/RS during one simulation run is determined by the constant $number\\_of\\_orders$."

    "The assignment must be handed in two ways: a report in PDF with the answers to each question, as well as this jupyter notebook file. The report has to contain concise answers to the questions posed. Avoid unnecessary long explanations, however answers to analytical questions without an argument will result in no points. Include all important python code in your report, but only include code of the processes you have modified (e.g. the Generator process in Exercise 6.1.b). Failing to submit both the PDF and notebook files will result in a point reduction. \n",

    "When making a PyCh specification, one does not build an entire model and then starts debugging. A model is build step by step. During each step proper functionality is checked. We therefore model one process at a time, and connect the process with a Generator and/or Exit process to test proper functionality. In order to test proper functionality we first use analytical methods to determine the expected outcome. Then we run simulations to verify if these outcomes are indeed obtained. If that is the case, we can be more convinced that the process has been modeled correctly.\n",

If it has to go to column $i \\in \\{0, depth - 1\\}$, it needs to drive a distance $dv \\cdot (i + 1)$, pick up the tote, drive back, and deliver the tote to the buffer. For driving the required distance, the vehicle first goes with a constant acceleration $av$ $[m/s^2]$ until it reaches its maximum velocity $vmaxv$, then it moves with this velocity and decelerates with a constant deceleration $av$ to approach its destination point. If the tote is located too close to the end of the aisle, it is possible that the vehicle will not reach its maximum speed.\n",

Express the time spent moving (one way) $t_{moving}$ in terms of $x$, $av$ and $vmaxv$. For now we're only interested in the time spent moving one way."

    "## 6.5 Exercise 5: Lift as two stage machine (5 points)\n",
    "In the previous exercises we focussed on modeling a tier. In exercises 5-7 we focus on modeling the Buffer and Lift, starting with the Lift. We model the Lift as a machine, which repeatedly does the following: request a destination tier, move to the desired tier, receive a tote (first delay for $ll$, then communicate), move to the ground floor, deliver the tote (first delay for $ll$, then communicate). In this exercise we assume that moving to the desired tier takes 23.0 seconds, receiving the tote takes 2.0 seconds, moving to the ground floor again takes 23.0 seconds, and delivering the tote also takes 2.0 seconds. Note that, in this case, this implies that the tote should leave the Generator and enter the Lift 25.0 seconds after the Lift has received the destination tier. All of these times are assumed to be deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Assume that after 1.0 second the first tote arrives at the generator. Subsequently a tote arrives respectively 10.0, 100.0, and 100.0 seconds after the previous tote has been sent to the Lift. Make a lot-time-diagram indicating how long a newly generated job spends in the Generator, and spends in the Lift. We have provided the function `draw_lot_time_diagram(locations, lots)`, which can be used to draw the lot-time-diagram. Below, lot0 has been given as an example. Use the simulation code below 6.5.b to confirm that your lot-time-diagram is correct. \n",
