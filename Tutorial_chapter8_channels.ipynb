    "\n",
    "To communicate across a channel we use *communication events*. We can send an entity over a channel by using the communication event `Channel.send(entity)`,  and we can receive over the same channel by using the communication event `Channel.receive()`. Unlike timeout events or processes, communication events do not start as soon as they are defined. Instead, `Environment.execute(communication event)` is used to start the communication event. A channel can transmit any object as entity; for example an integer, a string, or a custom data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Communication over a channel requires a process which is sending, and a process which is receiving. If a process has no other process to communicate with, then it will have to wait. Communication is only completed once the receiving process has received the entity from the sending process. If a process uses the `yield` statement, such as with `yield Environment.execute(communication event)`, then the process waits till communication has completed (from both sides!) before it continues.\n"

    "- A channel is defined with `channel = Channel(environment)`\n",
    "- Communication over a channel is done using communication events.\n",
    "    - A process can send an entity over a channel with communication event `sending = channel.send(entity)`\n",
    "    - A process can receive over a channel with communication event `receiving = channel.receive()` \n",
    "    - Communication events do not start automatically, they need to be executed through `env.execute(communication event)`\n",
    "- A channel can transmit any type of entity; for example integers, strings, or even a custom data type\n",
    "    - a Signal without data is named a *synchronization signal* and is done through: `channel.send(None)`\n",
    "- A channel can have several processes sending and/or receiving.\n",
    "    - If multiple processes want to send/receive at the same time, then the channel will select a sender and a receiver at random.\n",
    "- Multiple channels can be defined using list comprehension, which can be useful in combination with list comprehension for processes.\n",
    "\t- An example would be `channels = [Channel(env) for i in range(10)]`\n",
    "- Monitoring multiple channels \n",
    "     - A process can select one of multiple communication events. Only the first communication event which is able to communicate will be executed, the others are aborted. If multiple communication events are able to communicate at the same time, then one is chosen at random. This can be done through:\n",
    "        - `env.select(communication event 1, communication event 2, ...)`\n",
    "        - `env.select(*list of communication events)`\n",
    "        - or with a combination of the two: `env.select(*list of communication events 1-3, communication event 4, ...)`\n",
    "     - We can check if a communication event was selected by using the `selected(communication event)` function, which returns `True`  if the communication event has occurred. This is useful when we want to describe different outcomes depending on which event was selected.\n",
    "     - Guards are boolean functions which denotes under which conditions a communication event is allowed to take place. \n",
    "        - An example of a send event with a guard would be: `sending = channel.send(entity) if guard_sending else None`\n",
    "          - with `guard_sending` being a boolean expression denoting if sending is allowed to take place."

    "2. Six children have been given the assignment to perform a series of calculations on the numbers $0,1,2,3,\\ldots ,9$, namely add 2, multiply by 3, multiply by 2, and add 6 subsequently. They decide to split up the calculations and to operate in parallel. They sit down at a table next to each other. The first child, the reader $R$, reads the numbers $0,1,2,3,\\ldots ,9$ one by one to the first calculating child $C_1$. Child $C_1$ adds 2 and tells the result to its right neighbour, child $C_2$.  After telling the result to child $C_2$, child $C_1$ is able to start calculating on the next number the reader $R$ tells him. Children $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ are analogous to child $C_1$; they each perform a different calculation on a number they hear and tell the result to their right neighbour. At the end of the table the writer $W$ writes every result he hears down on paper. The figure below shows a schematic drawing of the children at the table.\n",
